# Interim_Analysis_of_Clinical_Trails

The purpose for this project is to analyze whether it was appropriate to end a clinical trial early if the test statistic had fallen into critical region when the number of tested samples was large enough although not all the samples got tested. If the result is that we can stop clinical trails early, it would be advantageous for many reasons such as saving people from being injecting vaccines that might be harmful to their health.

We will use blog post and R code by Frank Harrell at https://www.fharrell.com/post/bayes-seq/#disqus_thread as a reference. We will apply the idea in Frank Harrellâ€™s post and program, but using the beta/binomial model in Ji and Yuan (2021) based on sequential interim analysis. We suppose the vaccine is considered efficacious if V E > 0.5 and futile if V E < 0.3. Allow trials to stop early for efficacy
or futility.

The other purpose of this project is to comparing Frequentist approach and Bayesian approach. We will see that using Bayesian way of analyzing results would save 19\% of patients while achieve 95 \% test accuracy for drawing result of whether the data supports our hypothesis.

We will not only consider the accuracy of whether rejecting or fail to reject our hypothesis, but also also other metrics such as power, false approval rate (FAR), false refusal rate (FRR), true approval rate (TAR). We will also report the average sample size across all the trials, across those that lead to early stopping for efficacy, and across those that lead to early stopping for futility.
